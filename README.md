# RoomateMatching-and-Co-Living
"Our project builds a secure, intelligent co-living platform using ML to match roommates based on lifestyle and preferences. Beyond rent/location, it ensures compatibility, safety, and trust through verification and reputation systems for harmonious shared living."

Shared accommodation is increasingly popular among students and working professionals due to rising living costs and urban migration.However, finding a compatible roommate remains a major challenge, as differences in lifestyle, habits, and expectations often lead to conflicts and discomfort.
Most existing roommate-finding platforms focus only on basic factors like rent and location, while ignoring behavioral compatibility and long-term co-living suitability.
To address this issue, our project proposes a secure and intelligent co-living platform using Machine Learning to analyze user preferences and lifestyle patterns for better roommate matching.Additionally, the platform enhances user safety through verification and reputation mechanisms, aiming to create a harmonious and secure shared living experience.

This project presents a secure and intelligent co-living platform that uses machine learning to match roommates based on preferences, lifestyle habits, and behavioral patterns. A dynamic weighting system enables personalized matching, while verified profiles and a reputation mechanism enhance trust and safety. The solution aims to improve compatibility, ensure security, and promote harmonious shared living.

Existing System:-
1.Random or basic roommate allocation
2.Matching criteria is based only on rent and location
3.No analysis of lifestyle or behavioral compatibility
4.Lack of security, verification, and trust mechanisms
5.High chances of conflicts and dissatisfaction.

Proposed System:-
1.Intelligent roommate matching using Machine Learning
2.Matching based on lifestyle, habits, and user preferences
3.Dynamic weighting of factors like budget, location, sleep schedule, and duration of stay
4.Secure and verified profiles for improved safety
5.Feedback and reputation system to build trust
6.Reduced conflicts and improved long-term co-living experience
